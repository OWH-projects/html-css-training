<li>Chrome or Firefox, preferably</li>
<li>Text editor - Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac) will do just fine.</li>
</ol>

###Session outline
<ol>
<li>Tags: Open and close</li>
<li>Headers: h1-h6 (But really, who uses h6?)</li>

###Final product
By the end of this session, you'll have a working version of a simple web page. Maybe it's a portfolio of your work. Maybe it's a new home page for the non-profit you manage. All of the sudden, the code is a little less scary.

###The Web: It's text files all the way down
Basically, web pages are just text files with specially formatted content. Knowing this helps demystify the whole process.

Open your text editor. Type this:

<pre>
&lt;html>
    &lt;h1>Hello world!&lt;/h1>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

Save this file with an .html extension. Now open it in a browser. Congratulations: You're a web developer.

Here's how it works: When you type in a URL, your browser sends a request to a server, then it reads the "instructions" encoded in the file you've requested and renders the results on your screen. (The same thing happens when you request a page saved on your desktop.) This session is about learning some of the basic syntax of those instructions.

###How this could benefit you
<ol>
<li>You're curious about online formatting.</li>
<li>You want to make online assets to support your journalism: maps, charts, widgets, whatever.</li>
<li>You want to understand how web pages are structured because, eventually, you want to scrape data and automate web-based reporting tasks.</li>
</ol>
