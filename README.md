#HTML/CSS
This session will introduce you to the basic components of the web page: HTML markup and Cascading Style Sheets.

###The Web: It's text files all the way down
Good rule of thumb/huge oversimplification: A web page is basically just a specially formatted text file.

Open your text editor. Type the following:

<code>&lt;html>&lt;h1>Hello world!&lt;/h1>&lt;/html></code>

Save this file to your desktop with an .html extension. Now open this file in a browser. Congratulations: You're a web developer.

When you type in a URL, your browser sends a request to the server associated with that URL (actually the IP address). Then it reads the "instructions" encoded in the file you've requested and renders the page on your screen. This session is about learning some of the basic syntax of those instructions.
