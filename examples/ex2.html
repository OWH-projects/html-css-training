    You can create a CSS class and apply it to an HTML element, like we did with this div here. (Think of <code>&lt;div></code> tags as rooms in a home -- it's a way to compartmentalize content to target for styling or scripting.) On this page, all HTML elements with the class "banana" will have black backgrounds with white text, 20 pixels of padding and 2 ems of top margin, and they'll fill 50 percent of the screen width.
    </div>
    
    <h3 id="chihuahua">
    You can also target an element by its unique id. Here, the element called "chihuahua" is given an opacity of 20 percent.
