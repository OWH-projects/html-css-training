#HTML/CSS
This session will introduce you to the basic components of the web page: HTML markup and Cascading Style Sheets.

###The Web: It's text files all the way down
Good rule of thumb/huge oversimplification: A web page is basically just a specially formatted text file.

Open your text editor. Type this:

<pre>
&lt;html>
    &lt;h1>Hello world!&lt;/h1>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

Save this file to your desktop with an .html extension. Now open this file in a browser. Congratulations: You're a web developer.

When you type in a URL, your browser sends a request to a server, reads the "instructions" encoded in the file you've requested and renders the results on your screen. This session is about learning the basic syntax of those instructions.

###How this could benefit you
