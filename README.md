#HTML/CSS
This session will introduce you to the basic components of the web page: HTML markup and Cascading Style Sheets.

###Prereqs
<ol>
<li>I mean, a computer would be nice, but you can just copy these files later from the internet, so it's not required.</li>
<li>Internet connection</li>
<li>Text editor - Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac) will do just fine.</li>

###The Web: It's text files all the way down
Basically, web pages are just text files with specially formatted content.

Open your text editor. Type this:

<pre>
&lt;html>
    &lt;h1>Hello world!&lt;/h1>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

Save this file to your desktop with an .html extension. Now open this file in a browser. Congratulations: You're a web developer.

When you type in a URL, your browser sends a request to a server, reads the "instructions" encoded in the file you've requested and renders the results on your screen. This session is about learning the basic syntax of those instructions.

###How this could benefit you
<ol>
<li>You're curious about online formatting.</li>
<li>You want to make online assets to support your journalism: maps, charts, widgets and so on.</li>
<li>You want to understand how web pages are structured because, eventually, you want to scrape data and automate web-based reporting tasks.</li>
</ol>

###Session outline
<ol>
<li>Tags: Open and close</li>
<li>Headers: h1-h6 (But really, who uses h6?)</li>
<li>Linking. "A href" explained.</li>
<li>The Div. It's just a box.</li>
<li>CSS: Changing colors and fonts</li>
<li>CSS: Inline vs. stylesheet</li>
<li>CSS: Class vs. ID. One item or multiple?</li>
</ol>

###Final product
By the end of this session, you'll have a working version of a simple web page. Maybe it's a portfolio of your work. Maybe it's a new home page for the non-profit you manage. All of the sudden, the code is a little less scary.
